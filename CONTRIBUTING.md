## Contributions

The cookbook welcomes and encourages contributions from anyone. These can be suggestions, new recipes, updates, or corrections. Please follow the process outlined below when making a contribution.

### 1. Open an Issue

Before doing anything else, please open an issue detailing the proposed changes. This is to prevent multiple people from working independently on the same changes, and also allows for comments and feedback on proposed changes before any significant work is done.

### 2. Create a Pull Request

**Note:** Please use the pull request template!

All pull requests should refer to an issue, and only one issue. Please note in your pull request how you would like to be credited in the cookbook, providing a name or handle and (optionally) a link to a website. If not otherwise provided, the GitHub username and profile page for the person opening the PR will be credited.

### 3. Approval or Rejection of Changes

Pull requests must receive approval at least two of the cookbook's editors. Once a PR has been approved, it can be merged by any editor. Likewise, if a PR is rejected by at least two editors, it can be closed.
