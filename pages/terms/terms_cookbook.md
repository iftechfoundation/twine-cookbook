# Cookbook

The idea for a *Twine Cookbook* was heavily inspired by the *[Inform Recipe Book](http://inform7.com/learn/man/RB_1_1.html)*, a collection of examples to learn Inform. Compiling some of the most requested code solutions across multiple versions, histories, and even years of development, the original editorial team sought to create the same project for Twine. After publishing the first version in August 2017, the *Twine Cookbook* was born.

## What this is

The *Twine Cookbook* is a living document. It has rolling deadlines and is often updated multiple times a year as new requests and solutions to old problems are found and submitted. It is driven by the Twine community and finds inspiration in what others create and share online.
