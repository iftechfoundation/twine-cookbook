# Welcome to the Twine Cookbook

This *Cookbook* contains documentation, tips, and examples for using the non-linear story creation tool [Twine](https://twinery.org/).

## Reading the Cookbook Online

Starting with version 2.0, the *Twine Cookbook* is created using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme and plugin set](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

It can be found at `https://twinery.org/cookbook/`.

## ePub and Print Versions

The Cookbook is also available in an [ePub version](twine-cookbook-print.epub) that can be read offline on a variety of devices.

A print version will also be available soon.

## Building the Cookbook using MkDocs

The *Cookbook* can be built using Python. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

* `mkdocs build` creates HTML and CSS files based on the markdown files.
* `mkdocs serve` builds and hosts a local server version.

**Note:** Depending on how Python is installed in Windows, users may need to use `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` to install and then use `python -m` before any MkDocs commands.
