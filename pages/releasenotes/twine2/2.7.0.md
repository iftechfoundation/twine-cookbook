# Twine 2.7.0

Release Date: July 8, 2023

## New Features Added

Passage edit dialogs now show leading and trailing whitespace in passage names as `‚ê£` symbols, to help tracking down accidental spaces.

The app version of Twine now supports customizing its UI via a `user.css` file. More info on how this works is in the reference.

The zoom controls in the story map have been moved into the top toolbar, so that the amount of space in the story map is increased.

## Bugs Fixed

JavaScript and CSS edit dialogs receive the right amount of vertical space when open in conjunction with passage editors.

## Story Format Updates

Harlowe has been updated to version 3.3.6.
