# What is Twine?

Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories in hypertext. Navigation works by clicking (or, on mobile devices, tapping) links to change old, refresh current, or even load new content.

## What can you make with Twine?

Anything! Because Twine produces hypertexts that web browsers can read, the limitations on Twine are not in what can be developed with the tool, but in the web browsers that run it. Anything that can be done in a web browser can be done in Twine.
