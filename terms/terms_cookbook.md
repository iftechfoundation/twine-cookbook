# Why a cookbook?

The idea for a *Twine Cookbook* was heavily inspired by the *[Inform Recipe Book](http://inform7.com/learn/man/RB_1_1.html)*, a collection of examples of different techniques to learn Inform. Compiling some of the most requested examples across multiple versions, histories, and even years of development, the original editorial team sought to create the same project for Twine. After publishing the first examples in August 2017, the *Twine Cookbook* was born.

## What this is

The *Twine Cookbook* is a living document. It has rolling deadlines and is updated multiple times a years as new requests and solutions to old problems are found and submitted. It is driven by the Twine community and often finds inspiration in what others create and share through forums, websites, and online competitions.

## What this is not

The *Twine Cookbook* is not a textbook. While the editorial team tries very hard to maintain the code and produce the most current explanations, the examples rarely build across each other. The *Twine Cookbook*, like any other cookbook, is designed for a more general audience and serves as a companion to other resources. It is designed for learning from individual examples and not necessarily from a comprehensive whole.
